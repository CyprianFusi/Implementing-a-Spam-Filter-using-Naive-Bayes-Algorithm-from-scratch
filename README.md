# Implementing-a-Spam-Filter-using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-from-scratch
An **87%** efficient Spam Filter implemented from scratch using Naive Bayes Algorithm.

We coded a Naive Bayes classification model which is based on multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. 
An accuracy of **87%** was achieved on a test dataset, which is relatively good! It can be used to classify new messages as either **spam** or **non-spam** or ham.

## The Dataset
We used the dataset of **`5,572` SMS messages** that are already classified or labelled by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago **A. Almeida** and **José María Gómez Hidalgo**, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) or from [Amazon](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection).
